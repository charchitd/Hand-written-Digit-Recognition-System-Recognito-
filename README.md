It is Described as: 

1) â€”Digital documents are easier to store and process. The task of taking a decision to identify the character can be accomplished by using  Recognition is to make editable documents from the existing paper documents or image files by employing automatic classification methods to so that various operations can be implemented on the document with ease.   

2)-It reduces human efforts to a large extent, making work more reliable and time-efficient. A research was taken on to identify the gaps in the existing methodologies to come up with a solution. Recognito identifies isolated integral values by making use of Convolution Neural Network and Supervised Learning algorithms.   

3)-It learns from the regular training of database by inputs provided to it and, thus increasing the reliability and accuracy gradually.
